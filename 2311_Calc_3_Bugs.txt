Calculator V3 Bugs
....................................................................

Sin doesn't work
Cos doesn't work
Factorial doesn't work
Mode doesn't work (also unnecessary)
Select redirects to sin (and sin doesn't work, as stated above)
Can't only enter X
1/X doesn't work
When using "+/-", it shouldn't affect the history/stack by doing *-1
	When undoing, every other press displays '-1' instead of '5' or '-5'
You should be able to go to the graph even if there is nothing display or in history
	- The graph will of course be empty
Remove the decimal place limitation and opt for a scientific notation
Again, spamming undo will remove the "Start new calculation" message letter by letter from the right
Eval is working in the console, but not displaying it in the calculator
Pi then +/- doesn't work
Multiplying large numbers doesn't give the correct answer (Parts are cut off)
	- If doing 6 ENTER multiple times to have many 6s in the stack, you can multiply but eventually it forcefully stops
5 ENTER ENTER should have 5,5 in the stack
Something like (5!)! should work
	- Maybe have it so 5 ENTER !, then the history and display both have 120. When pressing ! again, the history is modified to 120!
How should we handle graphing for invalid functions? Empty graph?


Layout
....................................................................

Have the numbers appear starting from the right. This is more common
Fix colours
Fix button layout (3X3 please just look at a phone, keyboard, or calculator keypad)
The arrow keys and "Favourites" button are not centered
Favourites menu doesn't work
Fix the scale of the graph. Currently, the scale makes no sense (is it for sin/cos?)
	- Or at least change the graph scaling based on if there is a trig or not
Fix how the history is displayed. Have above the display, not right beside it

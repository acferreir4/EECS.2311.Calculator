(FIXED)
Spamming "undo" makes "Start new computation | value = 0" appear in display
	- Spamming undo on this removes a char each time
	- At the end, pressing undo makes this message appear again and cycle repeats indefinitely

Spamming "undo" after "ENTER"ing a number makes the calculator display "[XXX] | value = XXX" where XXX is the number
	- Same thing with "(XXX+YY) | value = XXXYY" after adding

In the case that text is displayed, ("division by 0", "Start new...", etc.) and select is pressed, an exception occurs

(TO BE DONE)
Any operations with large numbers in input or answer causes an exception
	- 999999!

20! gives overflow error (negative value)
	- In that regard, 33! also gives a negative number, but 34! and beyond give 0

Missing division by 0 error to display (currently throws exception)

Negative zero by changing sign

Dividing X by negative 0 gives 0/X

Multiplying X by negative 0 gives 1 * X

Negative factorial gives 1 (negative factorial should actually be invalid)

99999999999999999999... ENTER returns 10

99999999999 * 99999999999 following the logic from above point gives 10 * 10, but somehow equals 10

If you do 1 ENTER 2 ENTER 3 ENTER, an operation on 3 and 2 (for example +), selecting the 1st index (value = 1) doesn't work
	- The span and range in console show a value of 1, but should be 2 since 2 values in stack
	- This means that any history before operation may not be in stack
	- BUT (and this gets confusing) if without selecting, after adding doing something like adding again will add the '1' to '5'

Any number with the tenth decimal 0 will instead be rounded to 3 decimal places instead of 2.
	- Adding or multiplying any two numbers with this trait will give a 3 decimal place answer. Otherwise, it is 2 decimal places.

Combining the two above (traits and operations done), SELECTing the first index will yield the same result.
	- Selecting and undoing the 1st number won't actually do anything since right after, pressing + will add all three values.

Doing cos(270) gives -0 as the output value in the display.
